# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the afternoon session of this 1-day workshop developed for the OCS2024 conference. In this session we will run through some population genetic analyses to understand our data from different perspectives, such as: population structure and connectivity, genetic diversity, signals of adaptation, relatedness and sex-linked markers.

The focus of this workshop is to improve our interpretation of the results, not to practice our R coding skill. Therefore, the basic code is available to you and can be improved for your purpose. If you would like some refreshing on R coding and the data formats, have a look at the `Refreshers and tutorials` tab.

**Please ensure R and Rstudio, along with the required packages, are installed on your personal computer BEFORE the workshop. We will not have time to troubleshoot R install issues during the session. You have find a guide to install under the `Install packages` tab.**

Several example dataset have also been made available, but if you have your own data do not hesitate to use that.

## Here are some things you might see along your journey:

**Below is an exercise box, this is encouraging you to give it a go yourself!**
