	abstract = {Distance measures are widely used for examining genetic structure in datasets that comprise many individuals scored for a very large number of attributes. Genotype datasets composed of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) typically contain bi-allelic scores for tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of loci.We examine the application of distance measures to SNP genotypes and sequence tag presence-absences (SilicoDArT) and use real datasets and simulated data to illustrate pitfalls in the application of genetic distances and their visualization.Euclidean Distance is the metric of choice in many distance studies. However, other measures may be preferable because of their underlying models of divergence, population demographic history and linkage disequilibrium, because it is desirable to down-weight joint absences, or because of other characteristics specific to the data or analyses. Distance measures for SNP genotype data that depend on the arbitrary choice of reference and alternate alleles (e.g. Bray-Curtis distance) should not be used. Careful consideration should be given to which state is scored zero when applying binary distance measures to sequence tag presence-absences (e.g. Jaccard distance).Missing values that arise in the SNP discovery process can cause displacement of affected individuals from their natural groupings and artificial inflation of confidence envelopes, leading to potential misinterpretation. Filtering on missing values then imputing those that remain avoids distortion in visual representations. Failure of a distance measure to conform to metric and Euclidean properties is important but only likely to create unacceptable outcomes in extreme cases. Lack of randomness in the selection of individuals (e.g. inclusion of sibs) and lack of independence of both individuals and loci (e.g. polymorphic haploblocks), can lead to substantial and otherwise inexplicable distortions of the visual representations and again, potential misinterpretation.Competing Interest StatementAuthor AK is the Managing Director of Diversity Arrays Technology Pty Ltd (Canberra) and the originator of the DArTSeq pipelines and associated data formats (including SilicoDArT).

	abstract = {Abstract The concept of kinship permeates many domains of fundamental and applied biology ranging from social evolution to conservation science to quantitative and human genetics. Until recently, pedigrees were the gold standard to infer kinship, but the advent of next-generation sequencing and the availability of dense genetic markers in many species make it a good time to (re)evaluate the usefulness of genetic markers in this context. Using three published data sets where both pedigrees and markers are available, we evaluate two common and a new genetic estimator of kinship. We show discrepancies between pedigree values and marker estimates of kinship and explore via simulations the possible reasons for these. We find these discrepancies are attributable to two main sources: pedigree errors and heterogeneity in the origin of founders. We also show that our new marker-based kinship estimator has very good statistical properties and behaviour and is particularly well suited for situations where the source population is of small size, as will often be the case in conservation biology, and where high levels of kinship are expected, as is typical in social evolution studies.},
